    "It is saved in a csv file for you called \"cruise_ship_info.csv\". Your job is to create a regression model that will help predict how many crew members will be needed for future ships. The client also mentioned that they have found that particular cruise lines will differ in acceptable crew counts, so it is most likely an important feature to include in your analysis! \n",
